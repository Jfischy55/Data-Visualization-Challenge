# Data-Visualization-Challenge

I was able to complete most of the assignment, I had some trouble with a couple of the charts. I think the issue is the way I broke down certain columns into new data frames that didn't retain the titles for the columns. I think this is why I was having trouble pulling the information from certain columns, and charting them. I tried for a while to figure it out, but wasn't sure on the best way to go about changing that. Everything else should be there though.
